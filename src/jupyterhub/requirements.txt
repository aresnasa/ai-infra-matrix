# pycurl is optional and recommended for very large deployments to improve HTTP performance.
# It requires system-level curl-dev (curl-config) and SSL dev libs which complicate Alpine+Py3.13 builds.
# Omit by default to keep image lean and builds reliable. If needed, enable via Dockerfile with curl-dev
# and openssl-dev installed before `pip install pycurl`.
# If you prefer to pin here instead of Dockerfile, uncomment the following line and remove the
# Dockerfile-specific installation:
# pycurl==7.45.3
